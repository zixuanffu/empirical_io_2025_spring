some small tasks to do

1. create a binom matrix

there are N firms and k levels. 
Then it is equivalent to put N balls into k urns. Same as solving $x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_k = N$.
The number of ways is the same as arranging k-1 bars and N stars. The number of ways is $\binom{N+k-1}{k-1}= \binom{N+k-1}{N}$.

we want to compute a matrix binom such that the entry is entry (i, j) is $\binom{i-1}{j-1}$.
