# Functions
- [x] `encode` and `decode` functions
- [x] `calcval`
- [x] `optimize`
- [x] `ds_ma`

# Issues
1. not sure about the the mask when place is between 1 an nfirms

2. check the `optimize` function. especially the optimal investment...
$$(1 - \text{isentry}[w]) \cdot \text{val\_up} + \text{isentry}[w] \cdot \text{val\_up\_e} - (1 - \text{isentry}[w]) \cdot \text{val\_stay} + \text{isentry}[w] \cdot \text{val\_stay\_e}$$

1. need to double check that decode should work for nfrim = 1 as well.
2. qdecode you should not return the dtable but dtable.copy()
3. can run but the results does not make much sense.
