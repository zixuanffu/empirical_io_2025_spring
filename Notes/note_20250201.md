1. Let's say the bus $i$ at time $t$ has a mileage $s_{it}$. Then I can calculate $(x_{i1}^1, x_{i0}^1),(x_{i1}^2, x_{i0}^2),(x_{i1}^3, x_{i0}^3)$ for each $s_{it}$. Therefore, I would have $58*126$ $V_{it}$ values.
2. Then I use MLE to esimate $\theta$ in the following way.
$$\theta^* = \argmax_{\theta} \sum_{i=1}^{n=58}\sum_{t=1}^{T=126} a_{i,t} \log p(a_{i,t}|s_{i,t}, \theta)+(1-a_{i,t})\log(1-p(a_{i,t}|_{i,t}, \theta))$$

- $s_{i,t}$ is the mileage at the end of time $t$ for the bus $i$.
- $a_{i,t}$ is the replacement decision at the end of time $t$ for the bus $i$.
- $p(a_{i,t}|s_{i,t}, \theta)=\frac{\exp(V_{it})}{1+\exp(V_{it})}$ is the probability of replacement at the end of time $t$ for the bus $i$.
