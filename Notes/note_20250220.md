# Multiagent dynamics

## Markov perfect nash equilibrium
A MPNE is a set of strategies such that every firm is maximizing its value given the strategies of the other players.

This is a concept that rule out or select equilibrium strategies. It is a refinement of the Nash equilibrium concept.

It rules out:
1. Agents update their belief about each other's cost function. But the **beliefs** are not directly in the payoff function. e.g., ?
2. History dependent strategy **and** there is not sufficient statistics to summarize that history. e.g., ?

## Model: Ericson and Pakes (1995)

### State space
1. Anonymous and symmetric state: N balls into M urns. The state is the number of balls in each urn.

### Action space
1. Dynamic action: investment
2. Static action: price and quantity (why?)

### Timeline
1. Industry state $\omega$
2. Incumbent and potential entrant observe $\omega$ and decide whether to enter or not.
3. All the firms that stay in the industry choose their investment level $x$.
4. All the firms that stay in the industry receive payoff and the state transition to the next state.

### Value function
