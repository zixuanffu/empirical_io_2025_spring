In addition, there will be one “referee report” assignments. A referee report is a 3-page critical summary
of a paper relevant for this class. You are free to choose one of the papers in the references below, or
other papers. Note if you choose one of the papers that will likely be covered in class (marked with * or
), you must turn it in before the paper is discussed in class. You must obtain my approval of your choice
of paper for the referee report by the end of the second week of class.
